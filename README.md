A very small mod that adds the ability for players to add text above a player's name (like a note about them (saved in a TXT file so the text above the player's name won't be lost after a restart))



The mod opens its own menu by pressing F6.

To create colored notes, you need the mod: https://github.com/Antropomeda/ColorEnabler-Crab-Game-Mod
